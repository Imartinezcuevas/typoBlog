I got a Bachelor’s degree and Master's degree from the [University of Murcia](https://www.um.es/). Currently, 
I work as a Data Scientist at [Prosur](https://prosur.es/es/inicio/), Murcia.

Throughout my undergraduate studies, I was captivated by courses that introduced me to the principles of data analysis, machine learning, and statistical modeling. These courses ignited my enthusiasm for uncovering hidden patterns and insights from complex datasets, and I actively sough opportunities to apply these concepts to real-world problems.

In my free time, I enjoy going to the gym and playing padel, which keeps me active and balanced outside of work. Writing this blog not only helps me solidify what I’m learning but also provides an opportunity to connect with others interested in AI and data science.
